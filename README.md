# MIZU TWITTER
**Mizu Twitter** is a browser extension designed for anime fans and anyone looking for a cleaner, more enjoyable Twitter experience. It enhances Twitter with anime themes and customization options, hides unnecessary or distracting interface elements, and helps reduce exposure to algorithmically amplified political content. **Mizu Twitter** aims to bring a bit of that old internet spirit back, putting you in control so you can enjoy Twitter the way it was meant to be-fun, personal, and stress-free.

## Key Features
- **Theme Customization**: Lets you switch between cozy anime-inspired themes.
- **Distraction-Free Interface**: Optionally hides sidebars, communities, Grok/AI suggestions, premium features, and other clutter.
- **Political Content Filtering**: Automatically hides tweets containing political words, phrases, or figures.
- **Simple Settings**: Every feature can be enabled or disabled via the extension popup.
- **Persistent & Lightweight**: Saves settings locally and runs efficiently without slowing down Twitter/X.
